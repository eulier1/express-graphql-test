# GraphQL Server in an Express Web Server

### Eulier's Notes

Deep nested objects are very common in E-commerce applications or apps that scale with some technical debt.
So making GraphQL a perfect candidate.

It's actually amazing how easy is to query complex data structures for exactly the data that we want.

Our API is organized in **TYPES** and **FIELDS** rather than **ENDPOINTS**, which makes querying multiple endpoints for combining data, unnecesary, like in a RESTful API.
